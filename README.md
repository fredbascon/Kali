# Information Gathering
 - is a process of collecting information from different sources, such as books, websites, interviews, surveys, and more. 
 
   * NMAP and ZenMAP
   - NMAP and ZenMAP are useful tools for the scanning phase of Ethical Hacking in Kali Linux. NMAP and ZenMAP are practically the same tool, however NMAP uses command line while ZenMAP has a GUI.

 - NMAP is a free utility tool for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

# Vulnerability Analysis
 - a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system. 
 
   * PowerFuzzer
   - Powerfuzzer Fuzz testing or fuzzing is an automated software testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities. A fuzzing tool injects these inputs into the system and then monitors for exceptions such as crashes or information leakage. Put more simply, fuzzing introduces unexpected inputs into a system and watches to see if the system has any negative reactions to the inputs that indicate security, performance, or quality gaps or issues.

# Web Application Analysis
 - identifying vulnerability in software before it is deployed or purchased.
 
   * Vega
   - Vega is a free and open source web security scanner and web security testing platform to test the security of web applications. Vega can help you find and validate SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities. It is written in Java, GUI based, and runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/1HDC6fKsKYE?si=3g5pVIjArxz5eVNC>)
 
# Database Assessment
 - the process of evaluating the accuracy, reliability, and performance of a database system.
 
   * SqlNinja
   - SQL ninja is a Perl-based application. SQL Ninja is designed for penetration testers to automate the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining remote access to database servers. SQL ninja is also used for gaining shell Access to the database server. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/cx6Xs3F_1Uc?si=w1nLu0y9UTU-fx4a>)
 
# Password Attacks
 - any attempt to exploit a vulnerability in user authorization within a digital system.
 
   * Crunch
   - In order to hack a password, we have to try a lot of passwords to get the right one. When an attacker uses thousands or millions of words or character combinations to crack a password there is no surety that any one of those millions of combinations will work or not. This collection of a different combination of characters is called a wordlist. And in order to crack a password or a hash, we need to have a good wordlist which could break the password.

# Wireless Attacks
 - Wireless network attacks are deliberate and malicious actions aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless communication systems to gain unauthorized access, intercept sensitive data, disrupt network operations, or compromise the security of devices and users connected to the network.
 
   * AirCrack
   - Aircrack is an 802.11 WEP and WiFi Protected Access-Pre-Shared Key (WPA-PSK) key cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/4rnrfbb1-Wg?si=dfrApbBp3WHOVeAM>)
 
# Reverse Engineering
 - the act of dismantling an object to see how it works.
 
   * Yara
   - The official GitHub repository for YARA describes it as “a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples.” YARA allows anyone to create “descriptions” known as rules based on text or binary patterns. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/ahYXyv89Jts?si=JdkjpYNQZeZPYcLE>)
 
# Exploitation Tools
 - automated tools that can exploit the vulnerabilities found by the scanning tools or by your own analysis.
 
   * Metasploit Frameworks
   - The Metasploit Framework is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute exploit code. The Metasploit Framework contains a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/QynUOJanNqo?si=VGFdo8uqXkY52SWi>)
 
# Sniffing & Spoofing
 - sniffing is different from spoofing attacks. Sniffing includes the attacker's direct involvement with the target. They intercept network traffic to listen for and read unencrypted data actively. On the other hand, spoofing attacks are man-in-the-middle attacks in which the attacker impersonates another person. 
 
   * Responder
   - Responder Responder is an inbuilt Kali Linux tool for Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) that responds to specific NetBIOS queries based on the file server request. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/qIsUCVvJ-3U?si=m0a8jPfesMG7BGr3>)
 
# Post Exploitation
 - Post-exploitation refers to any actions taken after a session is opened. A session is an open shell from a successful exploit or bruteforce attack. A shell can be a standard shell or Meterpreter. To learn more about the difference between each, see Manage Meterpreter and Shell Sessions.
 
   * Netcat
   - Netcat (Network Connection Kit) is a command line utility used to transfer files between two computers connected via a network. It’s often used as a replacement for FTP because it’s much faster than FTP. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/ERZNMZZ2Uy0?si=quIrxeu84tv3SaAz>)
# Forensics
 -  laboratory or department responsible for tests used in detection of crime.
 
    * POF
    - P0f is a tool that can identify the operating system of a target host simply by examining captured packets even when the device in question is behind a packet firewall. P0f does not generate any additional network traffic, direct or indirect; no name lookups; no mysterious probes; no ARIN queries; nothing. In the hands of advanced users, P0f can detect firewall presence, NAT use, and existence of load balancers. [Youtube Tutoral](<https://youtu.be/rvVCZIIzLwk?si=p0Fmmy6C4CTZxNur>)
 
# Reporting Tools
 - Reporting tools, also called software reporting tools, are software programs you can use to report and display data so that it's easy to understand. 
 
   * Metagoofil
   -  performs a search in Google to identify and download the documents to the local disk and then extracts the metadata. It extracts metadata of public documents belonging to a specific company, individual, object, etc. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/3ss4CPrt0WY?si=_4rhvRiGrw98zJiB>)
 
# Social Engineering Tools
 - Social engineering is the art of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving you in order to gain control over your computer system. The hacker might use the phone, email, snail mail or direct contact to gain illegal access. Phishing, spear phishing, and CEO Fraud are all examples. 
 
   * Slowhttptest
   - is one of the DoS attacking tools. It especially uses HTTP protocol to connect with the server and to keep the resources busy such as CPU and RAM. Let’s see in detail how to use it and explain its functions. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/PkQoR4wt1L4?si=DtENs4RBTYsIJ_5M>)
