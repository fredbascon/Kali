MIDTERM PROJECT 
by Frederick Salazar & Krizel Allen M. Evallar

# Information Gathering
 - is a process of collecting information from different sources, such as books, websites, interviews, surveys, and more. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/cDryilcK39c?si=qz_AUZN6QJAf1Pmy>)

# Vulnerability Analysis
 - a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/zNvB3GVdQGo?si=HlYeB5FbmfIux5Tt>)
 
# Web Application Analysis
 - identifying vulnerability in software before it is deployed or purchased. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/o1-0w2-kVgo?si=ZMDWvjc7pLKTZsDW>)
 
# Database Assessment
 - the process of evaluating the accuracy, reliability, and performance of a database system. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/W_fH6CqiTDU?si=kXtjryV_O0U_w4oU>)
 
 # Password Attacks 
 - any attempt to exploit a vulnerability in user authorization within a digital system. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/z4_oqTZJqCo?si=OV_UiMlrC-zviei6>)
 
 # Wireless Attacks
  - Wireless network attacks are deliberate and malicious actions aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless communication systems to gain unauthorized access, intercept sensitive data, disrupt network operations, or compromise the security of devices and users connected to the network. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/ksUylvdJQDQ?si=C6Gw1xhugc4r99GG>)
  
 # Reverse Engineering 
 - the act of dismantling an object to see how it works. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/gh2RXE9BIN8?si=KW1Uwe8t4cFXGcTO>)
 
 # Exploitation Tools
 -  automated tools that can exploit the vulnerabilities found by the scanning tools or by your own analysis. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/B7tTQ272OHE?si=UbW3fDuQqA-UgLT7>)
 
 # Sniffing & Spoofing
 - sniffing is different from spoofing attacks. Sniffing includes the attacker's direct involvement with the target. They intercept network traffic to listen for and read unencrypted data actively. On the other hand, spoofing attacks are man-in-the-middle attacks in which the attacker impersonates another person. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/umPqpgbCSHY?si=F7GMfLjZDskdqsJo>)
 
 # Post Exploitation
 - Post-exploitation refers to any actions taken after a session is opened. A session is an open shell from a successful exploit or bruteforce attack. A shell can be a standard shell or Meterpreter. To learn more about the difference between each, see Manage Meterpreter and Shell Sessions. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/Eqi1a5gYXXo?si=86todzVnV0AoquFY>)
 
 # Forensics
 - a laboratory or department responsible for tests used in detection of crime. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/gOg_h9fdgZE?si=5tlaMW2tC6HEmMJJ>)
 
 # Reporting Tools
 - Reporting tools, also called software reporting tools, are software programs you can use to report and display data so that it's easy to understand. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/3N-NSrrDiMw?si=Tp4TK4Bd_3ukzoME>)
 
 # Social Engineering Tools
 - Social engineering is the art of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving you in order to gain control over your computer system. The hacker might use the phone, email, snail mail or direct contact to gain illegal access. Phishing, spear phishing, and CEO Fraud are all examples.
