MIDTERM PROJECT 
by Frederick Salazar & Krizel Allen M. Evallar

# Information Gathering
 - is a process of collecting information from different sources, such as books, websites, interviews, surveys, and more. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/cDryilcK39c?si=qz_AUZN6QJAf1Pmy>)
 * DNS Analysis
- DNA analysis is a most powerful tool for human identification and has clear forensic applications in identity testing (crime scene and mass disaster investigations) and parentage determination.
 

# Vulnerability Analysis
 - a systematic review of security weaknesses in an information system. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/zNvB3GVdQGo?si=HlYeB5FbmfIux5Tt>)
 * Powerfuzzer
 Fuzz testing or fuzzing is an automated software testing method that injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities. A fuzzing tool injects these inputs into the system and then monitors for exceptions such as crashes or information leakage. Put more simply, fuzzing introduces unexpected inputs into a system and watches to see if the system has any negative reactions to the inputs that indicate security, performance, or quality gaps or issues.
 
# Web Application Analysis
 - identifying vulnerability in software before it is deployed or purchased. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/o1-0w2-kVgo?si=ZMDWvjc7pLKTZsDW>)
 * Vega
 - Vega is a free and open source web security scanner and web security testing platform to test the security of web applications. Vega can help you find and validate SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities. It is written in Java, GUI based, and runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
 
# Database Assessment
 - the process of evaluating the accuracy, reliability, and performance of a database system. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/W_fH6CqiTDU?si=kXtjryV_O0U_w4oU>)
 * SqlNinja
 - SQL ninja is a Perl-based application. SQL Ninja is designed for penetration testers to automate the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining remote access to database servers. SQL ninja is also used for gaining shell Access to the database server.
 
 # Password Attacks 
 - any attempt to exploit a vulnerability in user authorization within a digital system. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/z4_oqTZJqCo?si=OV_UiMlrC-zviei6>)
 * Crunch
 - In order to hack a password, we have to try a lot of passwords to get the right one. When an attacker uses thousands or millions of words or character combinations to crack a password there is no surety that any one of those millions of combinations will work or not. This collection of a different combination of characters is called a wordlist. And in order to crack a password or a hash, we need to have a good wordlist which could break the password.
 
 # Wireless Attacks
  - Wireless network attacks are deliberate and malicious actions aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless communication systems to gain unauthorized access, intercept sensitive data, disrupt network operations, or compromise the security of devices and users connected to the network. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/ksUylvdJQDQ?si=C6Gw1xhugc4r99GG>)
  * AirCrack 
  - Aircrack is an 802.11 WEP and WiFi Protected Access-Pre-Shared Key (WPA-PSK) key cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.
  
 # Reverse Engineering 
 - the act of dismantling an object to see how it works. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/gh2RXE9BIN8?si=KW1Uwe8t4cFXGcTO>)
 * Yara
 - The official GitHub repository for YARA describes it as “a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples.” YARA allows anyone to create “descriptions” known as rules based on text or binary patterns.
 
 # Exploitation Tools
 -  automated tools that can exploit the vulnerabilities found by the scanning tools or by your own analysis. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/B7tTQ272OHE?si=UbW3fDuQqA-UgLT7>)
 * Metasploit Frameworks
 - The Metasploit Framework is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute exploit code. The Metasploit Framework contains a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection.
 
 # Sniffing & Spoofing
 - sniffing is different from spoofing attacks. Sniffing includes the attacker's direct involvement with the target. They intercept network traffic to listen for and read unencrypted data actively. On the other hand, spoofing attacks are man-in-the-middle attacks in which the attacker impersonates another person. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/umPqpgbCSHY?si=F7GMfLjZDskdqsJo>)
 * Responder
 - 
 
 # Post Exploitation
 - Post-exploitation refers to any actions taken after a session is opened. A session is an open shell from a successful exploit or bruteforce attack. A shell can be a standard shell or Meterpreter. To learn more about the difference between each, see Manage Meterpreter and Shell Sessions. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/Eqi1a5gYXXo?si=86todzVnV0AoquFY>)
 
 # Forensics
 - a laboratory or department responsible for tests used in detection of crime. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/gOg_h9fdgZE?si=5tlaMW2tC6HEmMJJ>)
 
 # Reporting Tools
 - Reporting tools, also called software reporting tools, are software programs you can use to report and display data so that it's easy to understand. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/3N-NSrrDiMw?si=Tp4TK4Bd_3ukzoME>)
 
 # Social Engineering Tools
 - Social engineering is the art of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving you in order to gain control over your computer system. The hacker might use the phone, email, snail mail or direct contact to gain illegal access. Phishing, spear phishing, and CEO Fraud are all examples. [Youtube Tutorial](<https://youtu.be/NekjERW5PsM?si=qg8O8jTDgKvvH-yT>)
